This file tests the corrected live terminal display functionality.
The display should use the terminal's actual dimensions (100x40).
This line is exactly 100 characters long to test width: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Key improvements:
- Uses actual terminal dimensions instead of forced parameters
- Preserves authentic terminal layout and sizing
- Displays content exactly as it appears in the real terminal
